# Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) Design and Simulation in ROS 2

## Project Overview
This project involves designing an Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) from scratch and simulating it in the ROS 2 environment. The simulation will include various aspects like robot modeling, control, and sensor integration using ROS 2. The ultimate goal is to create a versatile AMR that can navigate autonomously in a simulated environment.

## Project Status
**Current Status**: ðŸš§ **In Progress**  
I am currently working on this project, focusing on the robot's design and its simulation in ROS 2. As part of the development process, various ROS 2 packages will be utilized to model, simulate, and control the AMR.

## Features
- **Robot Design**: The AMR will be designed from scratch, including its mechanical structure and sensor integration.
- **Simulation in ROS 2**: Simulating the robot using ROS 2 for control, navigation, and interaction with the environment.
- **Sensor Integration**: Incorporating sensors like LiDAR for environment perception and navigation.

## Goals
- To design a fully functional AMR that can be controlled and navigated autonomously.
- To simulate the AMR in a ROS 2 environment using Gazebo.
- To implement various sensor integrations, such as LiDAR and IMUs, for autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance.

## Planned Steps
1. **Robot Design**: Designing the AMR's mechanical and electrical systems.
2. **URDF Creation**: Converting the robot's design into a URDF model for ROS 2 simulation.
3. **Simulation**: Using ROS 2 and Gazebo for simulating the robot's navigation and control.
4. **Control and Navigation**: Implementing control mechanisms using ROS 2 packages like `teleop_twist_keyboard`, `nav2`, etc.
5. **Sensor Integration**: Incorporating sensors to enable autonomous features.
